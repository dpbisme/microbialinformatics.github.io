## Announcements
* Homework is due tomorrow
  * Remember to supply code with a knitr document
  * Use `source` to load the code from within knitr
  * Results should be embeded in the text so that if I use `echo=F`, so I can still see what happened
* Final project (due 12/16/2014)
  * Email me your idea by Tuesday
  * Should be a program that others can use to do something useful (I have ideas if you need one)
  * Create a public repository with documentation in README file and license

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)


opts_chunk$set(tidy = TRUE)
opts_chunk$set(hide = TRUE)
opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
opts_chunk$set(cache = FALSE)
par(mar=c(4,5,0.25, 0.25))

## Overall algorithm possibilities

* Brute force search for all possible words in grid and compare those to the dictionary
* Brute force search for every word in dictionary in the grid
* A hybrid approach where you build words off of every block and end a search string when it is no longer in the dictionary

---

## This was (too) hard...

| Algorithm         | 	Time  | Time (with data structure population) | Requested Primary Memory  |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Full Enumeration	| 2,5sec+ | 2,5sec+                               | ~6MB                      |
| Active Dictionary	| 150ms	  | 170ms                                 | ~0MB                      |
| Branch and Bound	| 1ms	    | 300ms                                 | ~140MB                    |

## Some people take this way too seriously

* It uses the Beta Distribution to choose good, but not too good, words (to avoid all the suspects).
* It applies an istintive human reasoning. In this way, the final word list seems written by an human.
* It determines the current round, to change its behavior.
* Sometimes it draws casual words. In this way it never gets 100% of accuracy.
* It limits the number of words (a casual limit, that varies with the current round).
* It limits the number of points (a casual limit, that varies with the current round).
* Dictionary is limited, only a subset of the complete one.

## Whoa.

## How I did it

* Brute force search for all possible words in grid seemed most intuitive to me
* Neighbors will be the same regardless of the actual tiles
* Read the matrix in as a string and then convert to a matrix
* Start with 2 letter words and find all possible words
* Use all 2 letter words (2-mers) to get 3 letter words (3-mers), etc.
	* Make sure that you don't reuse letters
	* Do up to 10 letter words (10-mers, not exhaustive!)
	* Keep the path as you go
* Identify overlap between all k-mers and the dictionary

---

## Preliminaries

```{r}
# load the dictionary
dictionary <- scan("http://www.freescrabbledictionary.com/sowpods.txt", what="", skip=2, quiet=T)
dictionary <- toupper(dictionary)

# load the board
# BOIA
# RAMD
# TEHA
# IOCR

#convet the board string to a matrix
boardString <- "BOIARAMDTEHAIOCR"
board <- matrix(unlist(strsplit(boardString, "")), nrow=4, byrow=T)
```

---

## Precompute the neighbors

```{r}
neighbors <- list()
neighbors[[1]]  <- c(2,5,6)
neighbors[[2]]  <- c(1,3,5,6,7)
neighbors[[3]]  <- c(2,4,6,7,8)
neighbors[[4]]  <- c(3,7,8)
neighbors[[5]]  <- c(1,2,6,9,10)
neighbors[[6]]  <- c(1,2,3,5,7,9,10,11)
neighbors[[7]]  <- c(2,3,4,6,8,10,11,12)
neighbors[[8]]  <- c(3,4,7,11,12)
neighbors[[9]]  <- c(5,6,10,13,14)
neighbors[[10]] <- c(5,6,7,9,11,13,14,15)
neighbors[[11]] <- c(6,7,8,10,12,14,15,16)
neighbors[[12]] <- c(7,8,11,15,16)
neighbors[[13]] <- c(9,10,14)
neighbors[[14]] <- c(9,10,11,13,15)
neighbors[[15]] <- c(10,11,12,14,16)
neighbors[[16]] <- c(11,12,15)
```

---

## Final all possible 2-mers

* For each of the 16 tiles, make a path and a 2-mer for it and all of its neighbors
* Should be 84 2-mers
* Store paths and words as lists where the top-level entry is the length of the word (i.e. `paths[[2]]` contains the paths for the 2 letter words)

---

## R

```{r, two}
paths <- list()
words <- list()

this.paths <- numeric()
this.words <- character()

for(i in 1:16){
	word <- paste(board[i], board[neighbors[[i]]], sep="") 
	new.paths <- cbind(rep(i, length(neighbors[[i]])), neighbors[[i]])
	this.words <- c(this.words, word)
	this.paths <- rbind(this.paths, new.paths)
}
paths[[2]] <- this.paths
words[[2]] <- this.words
n.prev <- length(this.words)
n.prev
```

---

## The 2-mers

```{r, echo=FALSE}
words[[2]]
```

---

## What do we know...

* All the 2-mers and their path
* Could now take these and extend them by getting the neigbhor of `paths[[2]][,2]`
* Probably don't need the `for` loop, but we'll leave it for now
* Let's try 3-mers

---


## R

```{r, three}
this.paths <- numeric()
this.words <- character()

for(i in 1:n.prev){
	prev <- paths[[2]][i,]
	nextChar <- neighbors[[prev[2]]]
	goodNeighbors <- nextChar[!nextChar %in% prev]
	n.goodneighbors <- length(goodNeighbors)
	new.paths <- cbind(matrix(rep(prev, n.goodneighbors), nrow=n.goodneighbors, byrow=T), goodNeighbors)
	word <- paste(words[[2]][i], board[goodNeighbors], sep="")
	this.words <- c(this.words, word)
	this.paths <- rbind(this.paths, new.paths)
}
paths[[3]] <- this.paths
words[[3]] <- this.words
n.prev <- length(this.words)
n.prev
```

---

## The 3-mers

```{r, echo=FALSE}
words[[3]]
```

---

## Keep going with 4-mers

```{r}
this.paths <- numeric()
this.words <- character()

for(i in 1:n.prev){
	prev <- paths[[3]][i,]
	nextChar <- neighbors[[prev[3]]]
	goodNeighbors <- nextChar[!nextChar %in% prev]
	n.goodneighbors <- length(goodNeighbors)
	new.paths <- cbind(matrix(rep(prev, n.goodneighbors), nrow=n.goodneighbors, byrow=T), goodNeighbors)
	word <- paste(words[[3]][i], board[goodNeighbors], sep="")
	this.words <- c(this.words, word)
	this.paths <- rbind(this.paths, new.paths)
}
paths[[4]] <- this.paths
words[[4]] <- this.words
n.prev <- length(this.words)
```

---

## The 4-mers

```{r, echo=FALSE}
words[[4]]
```

---

## Could keep going, but...

* We will now have a lot of repeated code
* The only thing that changes is the number we use to index the previous k-mer length and the current k-mer length
* That for loop is bothersome
* Let's abstract this to make a function

---

```{r, getNext}
getNext <- function(paths, words, new.length){
	length <- new.length - 1
	n.prev <- length(words[[length]])
	this.paths <- numeric()
	this.words <- character()
	
	for(i in 1:n.prev){
		prev <- paths[[length]][i,]
		nextChar <- neighbors[[prev[length]]]
		goodNeighbors <- nextChar[!nextChar %in% prev]
		if(length(goodNeighbors)>0){
			n.goodneighbors <- length(goodNeighbors)
			new.paths <- cbind(matrix(rep(prev, n.goodneighbors), nrow=n.goodneighbors, byrow=T), goodNeighbors)
			word <- paste(words[[length]][i], board[goodNeighbors], sep="")
			this.words <- c(this.words, word)
			this.paths <- rbind(this.paths, new.paths)
		}
	}
	return(list(path=this.paths, word=this.words))
}
```

---

## The 5-mers

```{r}
update <- getNext(paths, words, 5)
paths[[5]] <- update$path
words[[5]] <- update$word
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
words[[5]]
```

---

## Put it together

```{r}
getKMers <- function(maxKmer=10){
	paths <- list()
	words <- list()
	paths[[1]] <- matrix(1:16, ncol=1)
	words[[1]] <- matrix(as.vector(board), ncol=1)

	for(i in 2:maxKmer){
		update <- getNext(paths, words, i)
		paths[[i]] <- update$path
		words[[i]] <- update$word
	}
	return(list(path=paths, word=words))
}
```

---

## Run it... ... slow

```{r, cache=TRUE}
start <- proc.time()
final <- getKMers(7)
end <- proc.time()
end-start
```

---

## This gets out of hand fast...

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(x=1:length(final$word),unlist(lapply(final$word, length)), xlab="K-mer size", ylab="Number of K-mers")
```

---



## About those `for` loops...

```{r getNext, echo=TRUE}
```

---

## Let's define a new function

* Take contents of `for` loop from `getNext` and use it to make a function `cat` (conCATenate)
* Modify `getNext` to create `getNext2`, which calls `cat`
* Also, we're getting nailed on recreating a new list every time we add a new k-mer. Let's drop the word list and create it at the end when we have all of the paths

---

## New `cat` function

```{r}
cat <- function(i, length, paths){
	prev <- paths[[length]][i,]
	nextChar <- neighbors[[prev[length]]]
	goodNeighbors <- nextChar[!nextChar %in% prev]
	if(length(goodNeighbors)>0){
		n.goodneighbors <- length(goodNeighbors)
		new.paths <- cbind(matrix(rep(prev, n.goodneighbors), nrow=n.goodneighbors, byrow=T), goodNeighbors)
		return(new.paths)
	} else{
		return(NULL);  #needed in case there are no neighbors remaining
	}
}
```

---

## New `getNext2` function

```{r}
getNext2 <- function(new.length, paths){
	length <- new.length - 1
	n.prev <- nrow(paths[[length]])
	path.list <- sapply(1:n.prev, cat, length, paths)  #<-- This replaces for loop
	return(do.call(rbind, path.list))
}
```

---

## Try again...

```{r, cache=TRUE}
start <- proc.time()

paths <- list()

paths[[1]] <- matrix(1:16, ncol=1)
for(l in 2:10){
	paths[[l]] <- getNext2(l, paths)
}

end <- proc.time()
end-start
```

* The lingering `for` loop is still a problem

---

## Now we need to translate our paths to words

* Let's look an an example (ignore the "goodNeighbors")...

```{r}
paths[[9]][1,]
board[paths[[9]][1,]]
paste(board[paths[[9]][1,]], collapse="")
```

---

## Think about the data structure we have

* It's a list where each value of paths is a different k-mer size
* Within each k-mer is a matrix of n rows and k columns
* To tranlate the entire list we need to...
  * Translate each matrix
  * Translate each row of each matrix
* Then glue it all together as a big vector of words

---

## R

```{r}
translate.vector <- function(x){
	paste(board[x], collapse="")
}

translate.matrix <- function(x){
	apply(x, 1, translate.vector)
}

words <- list()
words <- lapply(paths, translate.matrix)
words.vector <- unlist(words)
```

---

## What do these words look like?

```{r}
length(words.vector)
sort(words.vector)[1:100]
```

---

## A lot of that is jibberish

* Need to cross reference our `r length(words.vector)` words with the dictionary

```{r}
overlap <- intersect(words.vector, dictionary)

length(overlap)
sort(overlap)[1:100]
```

---

## Recall how we might sort these by length?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
o <- order(nchar(overlap), decreasing=T)
overlap[o]
```

---

## Now we need to recover the paths

```{r getPath, echo=T, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
getPath <- function(word){
	wordLength <- nchar(word)
	hit <- which(words[[wordLength]] == word)
	path <- paths[[wordLength]][hit,]
	if(length(hit) > 1){
		path.strings <- apply(path, 1, paste, collapse=",")	
		path.strings <- paste(path.strings, collapse=" / ")
	} else {
		path.strings <- paste(path, collapse=",")
	}
	return(path.strings)
}

sapply(overlap, getPath)
```

---

```{r getPath, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
```

---

## Things that still could be done...

* Calculate scores
* Return highest scoring path
* Figure out how to get rid of `for` loop
* Try other algorithm approaches and see if they are more practical (Remember we only go up to 10-mers)
* Pre-screen dictionary (e.g. exclude words with "X" since they aren't on our board)
* Test with other boards
